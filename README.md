# O2AS UR Project

![O2AS](O2AS.gif)

This project stores the software running the robot solution of Team O2AS in the Assembly/Industrial League World Robot Challenge at the [World Robot Summit 2018](http://worldrobotsummit.org/en/). Installation is fully automated, and the solution runs inside a Docker container. Only Docker is installed on the host PC (Ubuntu 16.04 or newer).

## QUICK START

1) Clone the repository into your home folder in Ubuntu 16.04 (or newer).  
2) Execute the three scripts (SETUP-DEVEL-MACHINE.sh, BUILD-DOCKER-IMAGE.sh, RUN-DOCKER-CONTAINER.sh)  
3) Read the documentation and report here if you have any problems.  

## Getting Started

All the necessary documentation and step-by-step guides to get started can be found in the GitLab wiki:
