`master`: [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/o2as/ur-o2as/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/o2as/ur-o2as/commits/master) `devel`: [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/o2as/ur-o2as/badges/devel/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/o2as/ur-o2as/commits/devel) 

This project aims to provide a development framework for Team O2AS in the Industrial Challenge of the [World Robot Summit 2018](http://worldrobotsummit.org/en/).
The goal is to provide a robust, maintainable, virtualized, and documented environment for all internal and external contributors.

## QUICK START

1) Clone the repository into your home folder in Ubuntu 16.04 (or newer).  
2) Execute the three scripts (SETUP-DEVEL-MACHINE.sh, BUILD-DOCKER-IMAGE.sh, RUN-DOCKER-CONTAINER.sh)  
3) Read the documentation and report here if you have any problems.  

## Getting Started

All the necessary documentation and step-by-step guides to get started can be found in the GitLab wiki:
